Parameters that were disabled would be grayed out.  Node report commands can be
sent when the node is expanded to get all the information.  This would only
work on nodes with a proper EDS file as there is no mechanism to poll a device
for the enabled status of a parameter.

Node Configuration Dialog and features

Enable / Disable parameters

Write to file from traffic tab

Add Connection status to the status bar.  Something like a blinking green light
or frame counter.

Connect dialog box needs to pre-set itself to the last used or configured
settings

Add Quality, Failure and Annunciate Flags to Data Table View

Protocol Help Reference, parameter definitions frame definitions etc.  Basically
the specification but in a help type format.  Probably HTML viewer of some kind
with enough smarts to either read the canfix.json or generated from it.

Online device file and protocol file updates?  Maybe online updates.  Links to
online help?

Save and restore configuration to nodes.  Probably use json.

Firmware updating has some problems:

  Test Firmware download on real hardware.

  Firmware download for 'unknown' devices
