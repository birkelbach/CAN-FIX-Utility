Remove canbus and canfix packages and used python-can and python-canfix

Parameters that were disabled would be grayed out.  Node report commands can be
sent when the node is expanded to get all the information.

Node Configuration Dialog

Change background color of data table if data is old and remove if it gets too old.

Add Connection status to the status bar.  Something like a blinking green light
or frame counter.

Allow multiple devices to be defined in one .xml file?

Fix Connection Dialog box to work with python-can

Add Quality, Failure and Annunciate Flags to Data Table View

[Protocol module unit tests.  This thing has a bunch of ways to not work.  Needs
testing.] Not needed if using python-canfix

Protocol Help Reference, parameter definitions frame definitions etc.  Basically
the specification but in a help type format.  Probably HTML viewer of some kind
with enough smarts to either read the canfix.xml or generated from it.

Online device file and protocol file updates?  Maybe online updates.  Links to
online help?

Put fgfs, netsim and serialtest into one program.  This way the simulations and
command structure can be together in one app.  It would eliminate a lot of
duplication of code.

Firmware updating has some problems:

  Test Firmware download on real hardware.

  Need to use the actual FW Code for each device type.  Right now it's hard
  coded in the __TryChannel function in FirmwwareBase class.  Also the FWDialog
  should try to figure out what kind of device is at the specified node.  The
  node  number is given so it should be able to ascertain from the node info and
  the EDS  files what the device type is.  If none is found then ask...

  Also need to test channel busyness

  There's too much code duplication in the firmware drivers.  They should be
  dumber and the firmware base class should do more of the work.
