Add navigation buttons functions to dialogs.  Mostly enter and escape.

Enable / Disable parameters

Write to file from traffic tab

Add Connection status to the status bar.  Something like a blinking green light
or frame counter.

Connect dialog box needs to pre-set itself to the last used or configured
settings

Add Quality, Failure and Annunciate Flags to Data Table View

Protocol Help Reference, parameter definitions frame definitions etc.  Basically
the specification but in a help type format.  Probably HTML viewer of some kind
with enough smarts to either read the canfix.json or generated from it.

Online device file and protocol file updates?  Maybe online updates.  Links to
online help?

Save and restore configuration to nodes.  Probably use json.  Also add a
"Save Entire Network Configuration" menu item.

Firmware updating has some problems:  REDO THIS

  Test Firmware download on real hardware.

  Firmware download for 'unknown' devices

Global configuration for our node number

Some kind of standard file sending / receiving protocol for some devices.  This could
be used to transfer more advanced configuration files, interpreter files, or
logged data files.  Would use the two-way channel mechanism.

Network health page.  Bus bandwidth (if available), errors if multiple nodes are
sending the same parameter.

Method to send certain parameters from the Utility.  Perhaps some kind of custom
page that we could use to send test information.  Configurable with json files maybe?

Save settings to disk somehow.  Probably use the ini file?
