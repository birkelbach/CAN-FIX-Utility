Main Screen:
  Add hot keys for menus and functions
  Add error pop up dialogs
  Add more to status bar... Status LED indicators, message counts etc

  Add hot keys for each function
  Git rid of the Apply button and save on changes
  Warn user when closing dialog with un-sent (dirty changes)

  Add Parameters to Information
  Add Update on timer or button?

Add navigation hot keys functions to dialogs.  Mostly enter and escape.

Enable / Disable parameters

Write to file from traffic tab

Improve Connection status on the status bar.  Something like a blinking green light
or frame counter.

Connect dialog box needs to pre-set itself to the last used or configured
settings

Add Quality, Failure and Annunciate Flags to Data Table View

Protocol Help Reference, parameter definitions frame definitions etc.  Basically
the specification but in a help type format.  Probably HTML viewer of some kind
with enough smarts to either read the canfix.json or generated from it.

Online device file and protocol file updates?  Maybe online updates.  Links to
online help?

Save and restore configuration to nodes.  Probably use json.  Also add a
"Save Entire Network Configuration" menu item.

Overhaul Firmware updating.  Allow updating firmware for unknown nodes and
especially make sure it works from the command line.

Global configuration for our node number

Some kind of standard file sending / receiving protocol for some devices.  This could
be used to transfer more advanced configuration files, interpreter files, or
logged data files.  Would use the two-way channel mechanism.

Network health page.  Bus bandwidth (if available), errors if multiple nodes are
sending the same parameter.

Method to send certain parameters from the Utility.  Perhaps some kind of custom
page that we could use to send test information.  Configurable with json files maybe?

Save settings to disk somehow.  Probably use the ini file?
