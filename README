CAN-FIX is a CANBus based communication protocol designed for the exchange of
flight data between aircraft systems.  This project contains various utilities
that can be used to monitor, configure, troubleshoot and update devices that
implement this protocol.

Right now the dependencies for this project are...

Python 2.7 - I have not tried it with older (or newer versions) but it'll 
probably work with 2.6.

pySerial - For serial port communication to CAN Bus communication adapters.

PyQt4 - At some point I may make this work as a command line only type program
if PyQt is not available but for now it's a requirement.

At this time the functionality is pretty minimal.  

The only adapters which are known to work are the Simulation adapter and
the CAN-FIX-USB adapter which is the home grown Arduino based adapter that we
made specifically for doing this kind of work. You can find details on it at...

The EasySync adapter driver is close and could be made to work with minimal
effort.  The Network adapter will probably just be a TCP based version of the
CAN-FIX-USB driver.

The only feature that really works now, is the traffic montitoring.  To monitor
traffic on the bus make a connection to an adapter from the Comm menu, and
select the Traffic tab on the main screen.  The start/stop buttons start and
stop traffic monitoring and the Raw checkbox is used to toggle between showing
the raw CAN frame and the decoded CAN-FIX information.
