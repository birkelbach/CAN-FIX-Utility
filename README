CAN-FIX is a CANBus based communication protocol designed for the exchange of
flight data between aircraft systems.  This project contains various utilities
that can be used to monitor, configure, troubleshoot and update devices that
implement this protocol.

Right now the dependencies for this project are...

Python 2.x

I have not tried it with older (or newer versions) but it'll probably work
with 2.6.

pySerial

For serial port communication to CAN Bus communication adapters.

IntelHex

This library loads Intel Hex format files.  It's for the firmware loading
functions

PyQt4

At some point I may make this work as a command line only type program if
PyQt is not available but for now it's a requirement.
